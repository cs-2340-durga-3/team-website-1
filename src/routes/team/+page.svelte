				He ensured that the website was responsive—that is, it would work on any size screen, so
				that people could access our app anywhere. In addition, he ensured the layout of the website
				was user-friendly and easy to understand. His design allowed for the users to seamlessly
				buy, review, and see their order history with clear visuals for each process.

			</li>
			<li>
				As a frontend developer, Nikki assisted Daniel in creating a good experience for the users.
				She tested the app on different size screens, providing feedback on what parts of the web
				app were confusing or unintuitive, so Daniel could go back and adjust them.
