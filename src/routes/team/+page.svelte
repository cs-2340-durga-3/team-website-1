				that people could access our app anywhere. In addition, he ensured the layout of the website
				was user-friendly and easy to understand. His design allowed for the users to seamlessly
				buy, review, and see their order history with clear visuals for each process.

			<li>
				As a frontend developer, Nikki assisted Daniel in creating a good experience for the users.
				She tested the app on different size screens, providing feedback on what parts of the web
